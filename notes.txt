📝 RPE (Rate of Perceived Exertion) – Quick Reference
Definition: A 1–10 scale that measures how hard an exercise feels to the lifter.

Purpose: Helps adjust training based on perceived effort, not just reps or weight.

Common Uses in Programming:

RPE 6–7: Moderate effort, 3–4 reps in reserve (RIR)

RPE 8: Hard set, 2 RIR

RPE 9: Very hard, 1 RIR

RPE 10: Max effort, 0 RIR (failure)

In This Project:

Used to guide recommendations:

Low RPE → increase weight

High RPE → maintain or deload

Enhances personalized, auto-regulated training plans.
