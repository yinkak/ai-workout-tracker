# 🏋️ AI Workout Coach: Your Smart Strength Training Companion

## Overview

The AI Workout Coach is a Streamlit-powered web application designed to optimize your strength training. It intelligently analyzes your historical workout performance, combining machine learning predictions with common-sense strength training principles to provide personalized weight recommendations for your next session. Track your progress, get smart guidance, and achieve progressive overload more effectively\!

## Key Features

  * **Personalized Weight Recommendations:** Get AI-powered suggestions for your next exercise weight. The system learns from your past sets, reps, and Rate of Perceived Exertion (RPE) to suggest optimal loads.
  * **Integrated Workout Logging:** Conveniently log your completed workouts directly from the recommendation page, or use the dedicated "Log Workout" page. Capture essential metrics like exercise, weight, reps, sets, RPE, and notes.
  * **Dynamic Exercise Management:** Effortlessly add new exercises on the fly. The app will learn and adapt its recommendations as you log data for these new movements.
  * **Real-time Model Retraining:** Every time you log a new workout, the underlying machine learning model automatically re-trains itself with your latest data, ensuring your recommendations are always up-to-date and highly personalized.
  * **Hybrid Recommendation Engine:** Recommendations are generated by a robust Random Forest Regressor model, then refined by practical strength training rules to ensure safety, progressive overload, and adherence to best practices (e.g., sensible weight increments, deloading strategies).
  * **Workout History & Visualization:** Review your past training sessions, visualize your progress over time with interactive charts (e.g., weight progression), and gain insights into your strength journey.
  * **Model Insights (Planned):** A dedicated section to understand how the AI coach works, potentially including feature importances and model performance metrics (e.g., MAE, R2 score). *Note: This feature can be expanded with more detailed visualizations of model behavior.*

## How it Works

1.  **Data Collection:** You log your workouts, including the date, exercise name, weight, reps, sets, and RPE. This raw data is saved in `data/raw_workout_log.csv`.
2.  **Data Transformation (`src/transform.py`):** Your raw workout data is automatically cleaned and enriched with calculated features relevant to strength training (e.g., volume, intensity, RIR - Reps in Reserve estimation). This processed data is stored in `data/transformed_workout_log.csv`.
3.  **Model Training (`src/train_model.py`):** A Random Forest Regressor is trained on your transformed historical data. This model learns the complex relationship between your past performance metrics and the optimal weight for your next session. The trained model and related artifacts (like the `LabelEncoder` for exercises) are saved in the `models/` directory.
4.  **Prediction & Rule-Based Refinement:**
      * When you request a recommendation, your most recent performance for the selected exercise is fed to the trained ML model, which predicts a raw next weight.
      * This raw prediction is then passed through a set of carefully defined, rule-based logic (in `src/utils.py`). These rules incorporate human coaching principles, ensuring the final recommendation is practical, safe, and aligned with effective progressive overload strategies.
5.  **Continuous Learning:** The entire transformation and model retraining pipeline runs automatically in the background after each new workout you log. This ensures the AI coach continuously learns from your unique training journey.

## Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to get the AI Workout Coach running on your local machine:

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yinkak/ai-workout-tracker
    cd ai-workout-app
    ```

2.  **Create a Python virtual environment (recommended):**

    ```bash
    python3 -m venv env
    source env/bin/activate  # On Windows: .\env\Scripts\activate
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Prepare your initial data and models:**

      * Ensure an empty `raw_workout_log.csv` is created in the `data/` directory, or if you have historical data, place it there.
      * **Crucially, run the data transformation and model training scripts manually once from the project root (not the `app/` directory) to generate initial model files:**
        ```bash
        # From the ai-workout-app/ directory (project root)
        python3 src/transform.py
        python3 src/train_model.py
        ```
        This will create `transformed_workout_log.csv` in `data/` and the necessary model files in `models/`.

5.  **Run the Streamlit application:**
    Navigate into the `app/` directory and run the main application file.

    ```bash
    cd app/
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

    Your web browser should automatically open the app (usually at `http://localhost:8501`).

## Usage

  * **Home:** Provides a brief introduction to the application.
  * **Get Recommendation:** Input your most recent workout performance for a chosen exercise and receive a personalized weight recommendation for your next set. After receiving a recommendation, you'll have the option to log that workout (with potential adjustments) directly from this page.
  * **Log Workout:** A dedicated page to manually log your completed training sessions. This will trigger the model to re-train in the background.
  * **Workout History:** Explore your past workouts, filter by exercise, and visualize your weight progression over time.
  * **Model Insights:** (To be further developed) View details about the machine learning model, including feature importance and performance metrics.
